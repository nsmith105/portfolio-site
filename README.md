Portfolio Site Repo
---
This is the repo for my portfolio site. It was created using Gatsby.js and the base tutorial from their website. I then expanded upon that with other designs, some borrowed, some original. 

[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) is a Javascript library that based on React.js. 

On of the developers came into my Full-Stack Web Development class and did a live demo for us. It was *very* effective, hence my use for this site!
